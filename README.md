<h3>Data Source:</h3>
The project utilizes the comprehensive dataset publicly available on https://github.com/kaoutharElbakouri/2021-Olympics-in-Tokyo-Data. This dataset encompasses a wealth of information about athletes, events, medals, and historical contexts.

<h3>Azure Services:</h3>
1)	Azure Data Factory (ADF): Orchestrates the entire data flow, potentially automating data acquisition, preprocessing, and loading stages.<br>
2)	Azure Databricks (Optional): Performs complex data transformations or enrichment if required by your analysis.<br>
3)	Microsoft Power BI: Provides interactive data visualization and exploration capabilities for deeper insights.<br>

<h3>Data Flow:</h3>
1.	Data Acquisition: The Olympic dataset is retrieved from the provided GitHub repository.<br>
2.	Data Preprocessing: The data undergoes cleaning and preparation steps to ensure consistency and address missing values or formatting issues.<br>
3.	Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to understand the data structure, identify patterns, and formulate specific research questions.<br>
4.	Data Analysis: Based on the research questions, specific methods are employed (e.g., statistical analysis, data visualization).<br>
5.	Result Interpretation: The findings and insights extracted from the analysis are meticulously interpreted and documented.<br>

<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
<h4>Research Questions:</h4>

1. How does athlete performance vary across different countries and sports?<br>
2. Is there a gender disparity in participation and medal distribution across sports?<br>
3. How do medal counts vary across countries? Are there historical trends (if data permits)?<br>
4. What factors potentially influence a nation's success in the Olympics (e.g., GDP, population)?<br>
5. Which sports have the highest number of participants? Are there any trends in sports participation over time?<br>

<h4>Analysis Techniques & Insights:</h4>
   <p> • employed Power BI for data visualization and analysis.<br>
   <p> • Key findings included: <br>
       o	USA, Japan, and Australia had the most participants.<br>
       o	Athletics, Swimming, and Football had the highest participation.<br>
       o	A strong correlation existed between GDP and medals won, suggesting resource investment's impact.<br>
       o	A high correlation between coaches and medals suggested their positive influence.<br>
