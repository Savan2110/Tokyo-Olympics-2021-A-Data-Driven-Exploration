<h3>Data Source:</h3>
The project utilizes the comprehensive dataset publicly available on https://github.com/kaoutharElbakouri/2021-Olympics-in-Tokyo-Data. This dataset encompasses a wealth of information about athletes, events, medals, and historical contexts.

<h3>Azure Services:</h3>
1)	Azure Data Factory (ADF): Orchestrates the entire data flow, potentially automating data acquisition, preprocessing, and loading stages.<br>
2)	Azure Databricks (Optional): Performs complex data transformations or enrichment if required by your analysis.<br>
3)	Microsoft Power BI: Provides interactive data visualization and exploration capabilities for deeper insights.<br>

<h3>Data Flow:</h3>
1.	Data Acquisition: The Olympic dataset is retrieved from the provided GitHub repository.<br>
2.	Data Preprocessing: The data undergoes cleaning and preparation steps to ensure consistency and address missing values or formatting issues.<br>
3.	Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to understand the data structure, identify patterns, and formulate specific research questions.<br>
4.	Data Analysis: Based on the research questions, specific methods are employed (e.g., statistical analysis, data visualization).<br>
5.	Result Interpretation: The findings and insights extracted from the analysis are meticulously interpreted and documented.<br>

<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
<h5>Research Questions:</h5>
<pre class="tab2">    • formulated specific questions to uncover trends, like:<br></pre> 
<pre class="tab4">        o	Participant numbers by country and sport.<br></pre>
<pre class="tab4">        o	Gender distribution in various disciplines.<br></pre>
<pre class="tab4">        o	Medal distribution across countries.<br></pre>
<pre class="tab4">        o	Relationships between participant numbers, medals won, and national factors (population, GDP).</pre>

<h5>Analysis Techniques & Insights:</h5>
<pre class="tab2">    • employed Power BI for data visualization and analysis.<br></pre>
<pre class="tab2">    • Key findings included: <br></pre>
<pre class="tab4">        o	USA, Japan, and Australia had the most participants.<br></pre>
<pre class="tab4">        o	Athletics, Swimming, and Football had the highest participation.<br></pre>
<pre class="tab4">        o	Most sports had a gender imbalance, with some exclusively female.<br></pre>
<pre class="tab4">        o	USA, China, and Russia led in medal count.<br></pre>
<pre class="tab4">        o	A strong correlation existed between GDP and medals won, suggesting resource investment's impact.<br></pre>
<pre class="tab4">        o	A high correlation between coaches and medals suggested their positive influence.<br></pre>
<pre class="tab4">        o	Participant numbers and medals showed a weaker correlation.<br>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
This project successfully explored the Tokyo Olympics 2021 data, revealing valuable insights into athlete performance, historical trends, and the broader Olympic narrative. While limitations like data availability or specific analysis techniques might exist, this project paves the way for further exploration and deeper understanding of the Olympic phenomenon.
