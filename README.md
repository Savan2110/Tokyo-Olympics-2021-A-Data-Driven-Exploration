•	Azure Databricks (Optional): Performs complex data transformations or enrichment if required by your analysis.
•	Microsoft Power BI: Provides interactive data visualization and exploration capabilities for deeper insights.

<h3>Data Flow:</h3>
1.	Data Acquisition: The Olympic dataset is retrieved from the provided GitHub repository.
2.	Data Preprocessing: The data undergoes cleaning and preparation steps to ensure consistency and address missing values or formatting issues.
3.	Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to understand the data structure, identify patterns, and formulate specific research questions.
4.	Data Analysis: Based on the research questions, specific methods are employed (e.g., statistical analysis, data visualization).
5.	Result Interpretation: The findings and insights extracted from the analysis are meticulously interpreted and documented.

<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
<h5>Research Questions:</h5>
    •	formulated specific questions to uncover trends, like: 
      o	Participant numbers by country and sport.
      o	Gender distribution in various disciplines.
      o	Medal distribution across countries.
